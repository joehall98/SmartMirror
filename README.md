# SmartMirror

A Raspberry Pi, LED Monitor, and a two-way acrylic mirror are housed in a handmade wooden frame to create a digital display in the form of a Smart Mirror with RBG LED lighting, two USB ports, and a microphone mounted to the device. The Smart Mirror's digital display is powered by MagicMirror2 boasting a range of modules from text-based calendars and newsfeeds to vibrant visualizations of the song you are currently listening to on Spotify and more. The aim of the project is to gain a better understanding as to why presently no major tech company have revealed any plans to include a Smart Mirror in their inventory of smart devices.

*The repositories for the modules are not included as they have not been edited and are large folders with lots of different files, instead the modules repositories can be found at the links in the config.js file*
